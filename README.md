RenderFinished sets up a a persistent callback to tell you when your renders are finished.

It only needs to be run once at the beginning of a session in DAZ Studio, or when you want to change it's configuration.
The only requirement for installation is that all files need to be in the same directory (except the README, of course).
Running the script launches a dialog from which you can specify the WAV file to be played and whether the notification does
Growl and/or audio notifications.

Presently, Growl notifications only work on OS X.

RenderFinished is released under the GNU GPLv2 (see LICENSE.txt).
